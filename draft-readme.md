# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Mashrur](https://mashrurayon.com/)â€”a dedicated R and Python developer with a strong affinity for open-source contributions. With a background in Social Sciences, I have a unique lens through which I view and interpret data. I leverage this expertise to dive deep into data analytics, translating numbers into compelling visual narratives that shed light on pressing social issues.

Beyond the world of code, I'm a fervent environmental advocate with a profound appreciation for nature's beauty and intricacies. My creativity also finds an outlet in writing, where I pen down my thoughts and perspectives.
